# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of a hackathon organized by the web app club Likelion (멋쟁이 사자처럼). The duration of the hackathon was about three weeks, making it a highly intensive and rapid development experience. This was my first group project, and I was responsible for the frontend development, primarily working with JavaScript (JS).

## Purpose

The project aims to address the digital divide, particularly focusing on the elderly population who often face difficulties using modern digital interfaces like kiosks. The rise of contactless services during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, making it imperative to develop solutions that are accessible to all age groups.

## Digital Divide

The digital divide refers to the gap between individuals who have access to modern information and communication technology and those who do not. This divide can occur due to various factors such as age, region, or nationality. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the reliance on contactless services, increasing the challenges for those who struggle with digital interfaces.

Examples include:
- Online lectures
- Contactless payments (kiosks)
- Delivery apps
- Online banking

## Topic Selection

We focused on the "age" factor of the digital divide. With the increasing prevalence of kiosks in various places such as cafes, restaurants, buses, city halls, and cinemas, we noticed that the elderly often face difficulties using these devices. Therefore, we decided to create a website that explains and allows practice with kiosk usage.

## Service Description

### Target Audience

Our service is designed with the elderly in mind, emphasizing:
- Intuitive design
- Large fonts
- Minimal buttons

### Key Features

1. **Tutorial Page**: Step-by-step guide on how to use a kiosk.
2. **Practice Page**: Simulated kiosk interface for hands-on practice.
3. **Quiz Page**: Tests users' understanding through various scenarios.

### Design Considerations

- The tutorial page mirrors the main page's intuitive design with minimal buttons and step-by-step instructions.
- The practice page offers missions of varying difficulty levels, allowing users to progressively improve their skills.
- The quiz page includes tasks like selecting a meal or drink, simulating real-life kiosk interactions.

## Self-Feedback

**Q: How will elderly users who struggle with technology access the website?**

**A:** During the planning phase, we envisioned collaborating with nursing homes, churches, and welfare centers to educate the elderly on using the service.

**Q: Does the service only cover café kiosks? What about kiosks in other locations?**

**A:** Mastering one type of kiosk will likely provide the skills to handle similar ones. We plan to update the service to include kiosks for buses and banks.
